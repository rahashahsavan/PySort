# PySort
A Python implementation of various classic and modern sorting algorithms.


First : Insertion Sort

This Python code provides both iterative and recursive implementations of the insertion sort algorithm. It sorts a list by repeatedly inserting an element into its correct position in a sorted sublist.

Key features:
Creates a copy to avoid modifying the original list.
Calculates time and space complexity.
Can be extended to include other sorting algorithms.

Usage:

Pass an unsorted list as input.
The function returns a sorted list.
